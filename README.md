**Latest Update:**
Welcome to the latest update! In this version, I'would like to introduce the notes system. It counts with the following functions:
* Create notes with a starting time, ending time, title and description;
* See all the schedules of the current displayed month in ascending order;
* See the days in which you have schedules;
