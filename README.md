**Goal:**

**Currently:**
The project shows the days of the month. It only works in mobile resolutions (not responsive).

**Working at the moment:**
Script performance;
Code polishiment;
Clean code;

**Future Implementations:**
Notes system;
Data-base integration;
Full release;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Latest Update:**
In the last update the whole js script was rebuilt. The former one contained a functioning code, but not the best. Good practices and better organization are also coming along. Expect a better performance overall.
Finally, the project still needs updates in its archieves and DOM organization, once it is done, the next implementations will occour. 
Happy halloween for everyone.
